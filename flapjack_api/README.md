# API for Flapjack data management system

The Flapjack data management systems allows synthetic biologist to analyze and visualize data from biological experiments. This system is provided in a serie of software that talk with each other in order to give the best expirience to every kind of user.

In this document, we will describe the API of the Flapjack system. This API is simply explained as a powerful tool that allows programmers to interact with the system, allowing them to create, modify, delete and read data. And also we provide tools to analyze this data with different kind of algorithms and the faculty to visualize the results. All of this implemented with the help of both RESTful APIs and websockets.

In order to get your hand on the API, follow the instructions on the [installation page](https://github.com/RudgeLab/flapjack_api/wiki/Installation-and-deployment).

## Other services
The full documentation of this API is available at the following [link](https://flapjacksynbio.github.io/flapjack_api/#introduction).

If you want to know more about Flapjack, you can visit the other tools that we provide for this system, the [Flapjack front-end](https://github.com/RudgeLab/flapjack_frontend) github in order to get a local version, our [website](http://flapjack.rudge-lab.org/) where you can find an online version of the front-end of the system, and the Flapjack python package, [pyFlapjack](https://github.com/RudgeLab/flapjack), that allows you to interact with the system from python.
